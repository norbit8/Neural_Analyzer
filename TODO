NOTES
1) in the Documentation : if user wants matching cells so he should put only matching cells in the input directory
2) matlab files should look likes this "populationName#cellName for example CRB#4391.mat"
3) when calling the class decoder, one should supply the directory of the input data, which should have the 
dirs 'PURSUIT' 'SACCADE' and if you want fragments then, 'PURSUIT_FRAGMENTS' and 'SACCADE_FRAGMENTS'.

TODO
1) MATLAB TO CSV method : save all files will be "NumberOfTrials#population"

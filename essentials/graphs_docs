plot_acurracy_comparision(one: str, two: str) -
    This method receives two paths for two data files, 
    and plots the data in a way that the x-axis is the accuracy of the 
    samples in the first file (one), and the y-axis is the accuracy of the 
    samples in the second file (two).
    **EXAMPLE** :  plot_acurracy_comparision("/data_dir/SNR", "/data_dir/CRB")    


plot_fragments(files: List[str], concat = List[int]) -
    This method receives a list of files (files), and the number of concatenated cells to
    show (concat).
    And it plots the framents graph for each population it finds in the dir.
    **EXAMPLE** : plot_fragments(['/data_dir/fragments/'], [1, 10, 20, 30])

def plot_histogram(files: List[str] = None) - 
    This method receives a list of data files, and prints the histogram of each data file.
    **EXMAPLE** : plot_histogram(['/data_dir'])

plot_acc_over_concat_cells(files: List[str] = None, number_of_concat_cells: int = 100, ticks: int = 1) -
    Drawing a graphs of accuracies over number of concatenated cells, of all the populations selected.
     and of all of the experiment types.
    It hase three arguments files - which is a list of data files,
                            number_of_concat_cells - which is the number of concated cells to show
                            ticks - number of ticks on the x-axis.
    **EXAMPLE** : plot_acc_over_concat_cells(['data_files/SNR','data_files/CRB'], 50, 1)

Instructions:
preparations
first you need to convert matlab files to csv. in order to do so,
arrange in input folder as such:
input_folder -> project_name : for example "Noga"

PAY ATTENTION - all the matlab file names has to be in this matter population name in CAPITAL letters underscore name of cell
for example CS_4985.mat or MSN _4547.mat.

now, you can create an instance of decoder, for example:

a = decoder(path for input directory, path for output directory, ['SNR','msn',CRB])
it means that this decoder will convert snr msn and crb files only.
for example:


now to convert matlab to csv call the convert_matlab_to_csv function for example:

a.convert_matlab_to_csv(exp="eyes", pop=1) -> this call will convert all the 'SNR','msn',CRB files
                                              from input_directory/eyes/saccade/ to output_directory/eyes/SACCADE/

this command will
a.convert_matlab_to_csv(exp="rewards", pop=0) -> this call will convert all the 'SNR','msn',CRB files
                                                 from input_directory/rewards/saccade/ to output_directory/eyes/PURSUIT/

if you want to add another popultaion for exanple 'tan', you can press the following command:
a.population_names.append("tan")

after finished prepations,
you can run the knn algorithim.

if you want to run for example, the knn algorithm oh the eyes experment on the pursuit with only CRB population
do as follows:

#set the population names
a.population_names  = ['CRB']
a.simple_knn_eyes(type = 0) (0 means that it is pursuit)

the results will appear in the file located in output_directory/EYES/PURSUIT/CRB

if you want to run algorithim on msn and snr and create fragments result file
do as follows:

a.population_names  = ['msn', 'SNR']
a.simple_knn_eye_fregment(1)

the results will appear in the file located in output_directory/EYES/SACCADE_FRAGMENTS/files...
